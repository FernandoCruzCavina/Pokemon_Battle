## A miracle Pokemon Battle
![build status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-complete-greenbranch=master)

This is an application that simulates a Pokemon Battle. But it has no effects on your attacks. You have Charmelion, Blastoise, Venusaur, Blissey and Gengar in your party. You try to play to see if you beat your opponent!

## Notes

I, Fernando, like to programming this game. I love pokemon games so making this one was a lot of work. It's my first contact with programing and with Java language, so i see the gameplay this game is so amazing, because i really feel like i spent too many hours testing while being entertained by playing my Pokemon.
